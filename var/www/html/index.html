	      Hello web traveller!  Do you like playing or making video games?  Do you like making games, but hate porting them to multiple devices?  Do you have convenient access to a smartphone and spend vast quantities of time staring at it?  Do you usually have network connection?  If you've answered 'yes' to a few of these questions, then, ohh my, I bet you'd like to learn about what HTML canvas is.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      HTML canvas provides a simple API for drawing shapes to screens.  This, combined with the power of javascript, allows people to make <a href="/canvas.html"><em>stylish</em></a>, interactive websites with minimal knowledge of DOM manipulation.  The DOM is lovely in its own right, but without canvas we would still be using Flash to make web games and ios users would not be able to partake in the fun.  If you're on ios currently then unfortunately you still cannot partake in much of the fun on this site as I could not figure out how to get canvas (an Apple developed technology) to work on these devices. Sorry about that.

	      I currently work at a web development company but have no formal training in programming.  Every day I interact with several web developers and gawk in awe of the games they make.  I believe that if I could get hired as a developer it would be like never having to work another day in my life.  I love writing code and thinking about systems.  I believe that today's most pressing challenges must be solved through the use of technology.  The only way the world can become an equitable society is through intuition we may gain through the use of shared technology.  I hope to go to Holberton school so I can problem solve with a diverse group of motivated people while doing what I love.

	      First I discovered Python scripting. Then I discovered C++. Then I got scared... Later I revisited Python and got acquainted with Typescript. I had an misfounded distaste for JavaScript because I thought prototypal inheritance was unwieldy and resented that it had become a cornerstone of the web.  I tried to rediscover C++, but progress was slow and I wanted to build!  Eventually I tried JavaScript again, and once I got the feel for it, prototypal inheritance actually felt kinda funky!  Now I've learned how vast the ecosystem of the web is and I've decided I would like to focus on this for a while.  HTML5 brings many fantastic technologies to the web.  Other than canvas, a few of the new features that HTML5 offers that I am most looking forward to exploring are: MathML (math formula rendering), Web Workers (background threads), IndexedDB (client-side data storage), and much more!
